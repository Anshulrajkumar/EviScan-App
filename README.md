In forensic investigations, digital evidence collection and secure transmission remain critical 
challenges. Traditional methods involve manual handling, delayed reporting, and a high risk 
of evidence tampering or loss. Investigators often face difficulties in capturing real-time 
evidence, maintaining its integrity, and securely transmitting it to forensic labs or law 
enforcement agencies. Additionally, absence of real-time location tagging, and dependency on 
paper-based logs make the process inefficient and prone to manipulation.


Our EviScan App, addresses these challenges by digitizing and automating evidence 
collection. It enables investigators to capture images, tag them with GPS coordinates, date 
and time, and instantly transmit them to forensic teams or FSL. This ensures real-time 
evidence integrity, prevents unauthorized tampering, and streamlines forensic workflows.
